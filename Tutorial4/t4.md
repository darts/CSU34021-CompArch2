***Q2***  
(i) 
cycles = 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R1 = 0x15  
The CPU can read values from the buffer O0 (and O1) and use that in the next instruction without waiting for the writeback to complete.  
This also means the pipeline doesn't have to be stalled at any stage.  

(ii)
cycles = 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R1 = 0x15   
The CPU cannot read values from any buffer registers as they don't exist and is forced to wait for the writeback operations to complete. This causes an increase in cycles as the pipeline must be stalled to keep data integrity (thanks to the ALU Interlock).  

(iii)
cycles = 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R1 = 0x06  
The CPU cannot read values from buffer registers as they don't exist but also does not need to wait for writeback operations to complete as the ALU Interlock is disabled. This means there are no pipeline stalls but the value in R1 is not correct as arithmetic operations were performed without waiting for the results from previous operations to be written back.

***Q3***  
(i)
instructions = 38 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cycles = 50  
There are 12 more cycles than instructions (in the order they occur):  

1. 3 cycles can be accounted for due to the 4 stage pipeline. 1 instruction will take 4 cycles to complete and therefore there will always be an additional 3 cycles.

2. 1 cycle is lost to a pipeline stall when the first load instruction is executed (`LD R2 R0 00` followed by `SRLi R2 R3 01` @ cycle =  10). Due to the data dependency (R2) of the second instruction (`SRLi`) on the `LD` instruction and the 2 cycle requirement of the `LD` instruction, the pipeline must be stalled for 1 cycle while waiting for the `LD` to complete. 

3. 1 cycle is lost to an unconditional jump (`J - - E0` @ cycle = 13). The pipeline has to stall to load the correct instruction (`BEQZ - R2 24`) as opposed to the the previously loaded instruction (`ST R1 R0 00`).

4. 1 cycle is lost to a pipeline stall during a conditional branch (`BEQZ - R2 08` @ cycle = 18) as it had predicted to not take the branch and had to stall the pipeline while loading the correct next instruction (`LD R2 R0 00` as opposed to the originally loaded `ADD R1 R1 R3`).

5. 1 cycle is lost to the same reason as outlined in point 2 (@ cycle = 21). 

6. 1 cycle is lost to the same reason as outlined in point 2 (@ cycle = 30). 

7. 1 cycle is lost during a conditional branch (`BEQZ - R2 08` @ cycle = 37) as it had predicted to take the branch and had to stall while loading the correct next instruction (`ADD R1 R1 R3`) to replace the incorrectly loaded one (`LD R2 R0 00`).

8. 1 cycle is lost to the same reason as outlined in point 2 (@ cycle = 41).

9. 1 cycle is lost during a conditional branch (`BEQZ - R2 24` @ cycle = 45) as the CPU had predicted to not branch but the branch was taken. Because of this it had to stall the pipeline while the correct instruction (`ST R1 R0 00`) was loaded to replace the wrong instruction (`ST R2 R0 00`).

10. 1 cycle is lost to the `HALT` instruction as it takes time to execute but is not counted as an instruction.

(ii) 
instructions = 38 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cycles = 53  
There are 15 more cycles than instructions. This is an increase of 3 over the number in part (i). These occur as there is no branch prediction to improve the accuracy of loading. Due to this, the last `J`ump instruction is incorrect 4 times resulting in 4 stalls. The reason there is only an increase of 3 stalls is because the branch prediction must make a mistake to update the predicted path, the last `J`ump instruction is incorrect 1 time with branch prediction. 
This results in a difference of 3 branches.
