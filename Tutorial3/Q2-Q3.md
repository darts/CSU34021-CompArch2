## Q3 Results

**Looping within the code**  
The following result was obtained by compiling and running the **ackermannTrim.c** file with the Linux `time` command.

real    1m38.730s  
user    1m38.463s  
sys     0m0.052s  

Here we only need to focus on the user time, as this is the amount of time spent by the system running the program.  
Since the **ackermannTrim** file runs the function 100,000 times we end up with a time of _0.00098463_ seconds or _0.98463_ milliseconds.

**Looping outside of the code**  
To check if there was any difference between looping the function within the C code and looping it outside of the C code, the **ackermannTrimNoLoop.c** file was run 100,000 from the terminal using:   
``` 
for x in {0..100000}
do
    ./a.out
done
```  
and the time was measured using the Linux `time` command again:
